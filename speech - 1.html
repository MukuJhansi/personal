    <h1>Esteemed Chair, Delegates</h1>

<p>I am thrilled to represent the Democratic Republic of Congo a country, with a heritage and a resilient spirit that has confronted significant challenges and conflicts. While military alliances can offer support during crises they also carry the risk of escalating tensions. The DRC emphasizes the importance of alliances based on cooperation, fairness and respect for law with a focus on promoting peace and stability.</p>

<P>Our past experiences have taught us that genuine security is achieved through diplomacy peace building efforts and sustainable development. We call upon member nations to ensure that alliances serve as instruments for peace than sources of division. Lets collaborate towards shaping a world where military partnerships promote justice, equality and mutual understanding while encouraging dialogue and cooperation, for enduring harmony.</P>

Thank you.
